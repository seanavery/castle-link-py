> read/write to castle-creations esc with python

## why?

Want to get the vEgo (velocity) of your rc-car without installing wheel encoders? How about realtime battery metrics? You can evern control the throttle without a pwm driver from any linux machine with a usb port!

## how?

### hardware
- Castle Creations ESC
- Castle Creations Serial Link
- FTDI Serial TTY Adapter

### software
- TODO

## Remove sudo requirement
```
sudo usermod -a -G dialout
```
